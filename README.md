# Weather Analysis

## Overview Weather Analysis

### Purpose of this Weather Analysis

#### In this new product, the recommendations and some changes will be applied to take the application to the next level. Specifically, the weather description was added to the weather data.
#### For this challenge, the weather description data you have already obtained in this module was used to improve the PlanMyTrip app. Also, input statements were used to filter the data based on weather preferences, which was used to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. The beta tester could choose in this version of the app four cities from the list of possible travel destinations to create a travel itinerary. Finally, using the Google Maps Directions API, a travel route between the four cities and a marker layer map were created.
